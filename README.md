An Image Palette Generator is a tool that extracts dominant colors from an image and presents them as a color palette. This is commonly used in graphic design, UI/UX development, and digital art to create aesthetically pleasing color schemes.

In Python, we can achieve this using libraries like OpenCV, PIL (Pillow), and K-means clustering from Scikit-Learn.
